Of recent times, there has been an increasing awareness about free and open source softwares and the added advantages that they bring in the tech-savvy community but the trend is yet to catch up in non-technical masses. The principle reason behind the lagging trend is that wherein the OSSs hit the bull’s eye over the security aspect, it lags in such yet another crucial dimension, one which encompasses errors and glitches that are so ubiquitous in these softwares that it becomes imperative to get rid of them as soon as possible.

Our aim through the project we are proposing is to bring these bugs into open scrutiny by creating a unified platform for people who observe these glitched to report it and people who are willing to solve some issues can look up from here and propose their solutions. This effectively bridges the gap between the general public who are preparing to be at the behest of this softwares and the developers who can solve them.

Furthermore, the platform can also serve as a catalogue of open source softwares that form best alternatives to the in-market proprietary softwares. This serves the greater good that open source licenses have to offer and at the same time, bring about a change that is positive and welcome.

We three having personally used these softwares and attended a score of seminars on them have been driven and inclined towards the ideology that free and open source softwares hold up. We believe in freedom of code and software. We believe that it is of paramount importance to be able to look into the inner workings of our computers and its nuances.

Furthermore, this particular project was chosen because of the amount of learning it offers and what’s best, it caters to our individual passions just right. The bulk of things that we shall be learning towards this project are more than relevant to the present times and most importantly, shall train us to be better software engineers. We have seen through the possibilities in this arena and we just can’t wait to get started.
